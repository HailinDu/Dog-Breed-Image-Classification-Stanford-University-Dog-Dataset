# Dog-Breed-Image-Classification
### Motivation
#### Knowledge Enhancement in Deep Learning 
The purpose of this project is to enhance the fundamental understanding of Convolutional Neural Network, have a handful of experience working with Tensorflow and Keras libraries, and apply transfer learning techniques to see how the model changes. 
#### For Future Dog Owner 
Also, as a future dog parent, understanding the difference between breeds and get familiar with them will be helpful to select the best dog that fits your lifestyle.
