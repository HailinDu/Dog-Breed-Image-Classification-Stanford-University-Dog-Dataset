# Dog-Breed-Image-Classification
### Motivation
#### Knowledge Enhancement in Deep Learning 
The purpose of this project is to enhance the fundamental understanding of Convolutional Neural Network, have a handful of experience working with Tensorflow and Keras libraries, and apply transfer learning techniques to see how the model changes. 
#### For Future Dog Owner 
Also, as a future dog parent, understanding the difference between breeds and get familiar with them will be helpful to select the best dog that fits your lifestyle.

### Dataset & Data Preprocessing 
The dataset is from [Stanford University](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/main.html), with a total of 20580 images and 120 breeds. Also, we can do one extra step to help us better understand the difference between dogs, which is to use the American Kennel Club's [List of Breeds by Group](https://www.akc.org/public-education/resources/general-tips-information/dog-breeds-sorted-groups/) information to assign 120 breeds into nine groups. By doing that, we may able to discover more insights about puppies.
